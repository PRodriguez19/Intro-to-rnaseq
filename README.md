## Description

This repository has teaching materials for the analysis of an NGS dataset. This unit focuses on teaching basic computational skills to enable the pre-processing of NGS dataset, using RNA-seq analysis as an example. In addition to processing FASTQ files to count data, this unit covers best practices such as experimental design and data organization/management.

## Learning Objectives

1.	Understand the necessity for, and use of, the command line interface (bash) and HPC for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data.
2.	Implement best practices for the analysis of an NGS dataset.
