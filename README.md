# Introduction to RNA-seq (Feb 7th - March 9th) 

## Teaching Materials 
This repository contains teaching materials from [hbctraining](https://github.com/hbctraining) but has been modified to support students enrolled in MMG232: Advanced Bioinformatics at the University of Vermont. The full citation for this work is provided below. 

## Description

This repository has teaching materials for an Introduction to RNA-sequencing data analysis. This unit focuses on teaching basic computational skills to enable the effective use of an high-performance computing environment to implement an RNA-seq data analysis workflow. In addition to running the RNA-seq workflow from FASTQ files to count data, this unit covers best practice guidelines for RNA-seq experimental design and data organization/management.

## Learning Objectives

1.	Understand the necessity for, and use of, the command line interface (bash) and HPC for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data.
2.	Understand best practices for designing an RNA-seq experiment and analysis the resulting data.

# Introduction to R (March 21st - April 6th) 

These materials are intended to provide a **quick overview** of the R programming language in addition to more training in generating plots required for interpreting NGS datasets. Although we are concentrating on RNA-Seq datasets, most of these visualizations can be applied to other NGS data types as well.
