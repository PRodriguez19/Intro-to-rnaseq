# Brief intro to R and RStudio 

## Learning Objectives

* Describe R and RStudio.
* Interact with R using RStudio.
* Use the various features of RStudio.

## What is R and RStudio?

Here, we will assume that you are using R via RStudio. First time users often confuse the two. At its simplest, R is like a car's engine while RStudio is like a car's dashboard as illustrated in the Figure below.

More precisely, R is a programming language that runs computations, while RStudio is an **integrated development environment (IDE)** that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. 

RStudio provides an environment with many features to make using R easier and is a great alternative to working on R in the terminal.

* Graphical user interface, not just a command prompt
* Great learning tool 
* Free for academic use
* Platform agnostic
* Open source


## RStudio Interface

**The RStudio interface has four main panels:**

1. **Console**: where you can type commands and see output. *The console is all you would see if you ran R in the command line without RStudio.*
2. **Script editor**: where you can type out commands and save to file. You can also submit the commands to run in the console.
3. **Environment/History**: environment shows all active objects and history keeps track of all commands run in console
4. **Files/Plots/Packages/Help**

## Creating a new project directory in RStudio

Let's create a new project directory for our "Introduction to R" lesson today. 

1. Open RStudio
2. Go to the `File` menu and select `New Project`.
3. In the `New Project` window, choose `New Directory`. Then, choose `New Project`. Name your new directory `Intro-to-R` and then "Create the project as subdirectory of:" the Desktop (or location of your choice).
4. Click on `Create Project`.
5. After your project is completed, if the project does not automatically open in RStudio, then go to the `File` menu, select `Open Project`, and choose `Intro-to-R.Rproj`.
6. When RStudio opens, you will see three panels in the window.
7. Go to the `File` menu and select `New File`, and select `R Script`. The RStudio interface should now look like the screenshot below.

## Organizing your working directory & setting up

### Viewing your working directory

Before we organize our working directory, let's check to see where our current working directory is located by typing into the console:

```r
getwd()
```

Your working directory should be the `Intro-to-R` folder constructed when you created the project. The working directory is where RStudio will automatically look for any files you bring in and where it will automatically save any files you create, unless otherwise specified. 

You can visualize your working directory by selecting the `Files` tab from the **Files/Plots/Packages/Help** window.

If you wanted to choose a different directory to be your working directory, you could navigate to a different folder in the `Files` tab, then, click on the `More` dropdown menu and select `Set As Working Directory`.

### Structuring your working directory
To organize your working directory for a particular analysis, you should separate the original data (raw data) from intermediate datasets. For instance, you may want to create a `data/` directory within your working directory that stores the raw data, and have a `results/` directory for intermediate datasets and a `figures/` directory for the plots you will generate.

Let's create these three directories within your working directory by clicking on `New Folder` within the `Files` tab.

When finished, your working directory should look like:

### Adding files to your working directory

There are a few files that we will be working with in the next few lessons and you can access them using the links provided below. If you right click on the link, and "Save link as..". Choose `~/Desktop/Intro-to-R/data` as the destination of the file. You should now see the file appear in your working directory. **We will discuss these files a bit later in the lesson.**

* Download the **normalized counts file** by right clicking on [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbctraining/Training-modules/master/IntroR/data/counts.rpkm.csv)
* Download **metadata file** using [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbctraining/Training-modules/master/IntroR/data/mouse_exp_design.csv)


## Best practices

Before we move on to more complex concepts and getting familiar with the language, we want to point out a few things about best practices when working with R which will help you stay organized in the long run:

* Code and workflow are more reproducible if we can document everything that we do. Our end goal is not just to "do stuff", but to do it in a way that anyone can easily and exactly replicate our workflow and results. **All code should be written in the script editor and saved to file, rather than working in the console.** 
* The **R console** should be mainly used to inspect objects, test a function or get help. 
* Use `#` signs to comment. **Comment liberally** in your R scripts. This will help future you and other collaborators know what each line of code (or code block) was meant to do. Anything to the right of a `#` is ignored by R. *A shortcut for this is `Ctrl + Shift + C` if you want to comment an entire chunk of text.*
